Caches the Toolbar to speedup your site
 
== Description ==
 
Just activate and this small plugin can speedup your site by some fractions of a second.

It caches the contents of the Toolbar you see at the top of each page when you are logged in.
There will be only noticeable speedup if other plugins are taking long to create their menu.
Menus with counters are often slow. If you don't have such a plugin installed, Toolbar Cached will do nothing.

The plugin does not require any configuration and does not have a settings screen. 
It will only display the time it saved generating the menu next to your Profile Name on the right.

 
== Installation ==
 
Just activate and look for a number like `42 ms` in your Toolbar.
